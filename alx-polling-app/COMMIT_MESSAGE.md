## AI-Assisted Development Process
ðŸ¤– This entire project was developed using AI-powered coding assistance:

- **Architecture Design**: AI helped design the comprehensive system architecture including database schema, API structure, and component organization
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Complete authentication system, poll management, and UI components built with AI guidance
- **Code Generation**: AI-assisted implementation of complex features like real-time voting and form validation
- **Error Resolution**: AI helped debug database relationship issues and implement proper error handling
- **Best Practices**: AI guidance ensured modern TypeScript patterns, React hooks, and Supabase integration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and code documentation generated with AI assistance

## Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protecting all database operations
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- User ownership verification for poll management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management with Supabase Auth

## Performance Optimizations
